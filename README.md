# dice-api
Simple dice rolling application with Ruby Sinatra
I'm writing this app to play and learn the Sinatra framework.
I integrate this in my home page, see it in action here https://tuxmal.noip.me/dadi.html
Now adding card drawing from a deck: using devops against humanity as card (see https://github.com/bridgetkromhout/devops-against-humanity ).

Feel free to watch and suggest any change!

Cheers!
