# dice-api

## Simple dice rolling (and drawing card) app with Sinatra and Ruby ##

I'm writing this app to learn and play with the Sinatra framework and API services.  
I integrate the app as backend in my home page the API are served through Passenger for Apache: see it in action [here](https://tuxmal.noip.me/dadi.html) [1] throw your dice ad see the result!

Now adding card drawing from a deck: using devops against humanity as card (see [devops against humanity repo](https://github.com/bridgetkromhout/devops-against-humanity) [2]).

Feel free to watch into this project, fork it, pull any request and suggest any change!

Cheers!

Antonio "_TuxmAL_" Liccardo
